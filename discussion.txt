2.3
I created models with 10, 20, and 30 components to identify what happens to the accuracy - however, they all only got 1 speaker right,
so I looked at their top5 accuracy, to see how many at least got the right answer in their top 5, and there was at least somewhat
of a trend here - the 10 part GMM had a 13% accuracy rate, and the 20 and 30 part GMMs had a 20% rate. I think I either needed to run
the training for more iterations or vary the the number of Gaussians more widely (ie 1, 10, 100) to see more of a trend, but I would
expect accuracy in general to increase with the number of Gaussians, up to a point. 

The same happened when I varied epsilon, so again I looked at the top 5 accuracy rate, where the results were somewhat unclear. 
I used 1, 10, 100, and 1000 as my epsilons, and 1 had a 13% rate, 10 had 20%, 100 had 20%, and 1000 had 13% again. This last drop is
likely due to performing less iterations - the epsilon limit kicked in before the iteration limit. For the epsilon=1 model, it
was probably the reverse - the iterations kicked in before the iterative improvement could be brought below one.
In general, if the were limitless iterations, I would expect smaller epsilons to yield higher accuracies.

How to improve accuracy without adding data: 
I imagine that it can be empirically determined what the best number of Gaussians is to use for speech. While not enough won't
capture all the necessary details, too many will make the model too specific to the training data, and fail to identify new 
data.

When would model decide the utterance is from nobody it knows?
Again it is likely possible to empirically determine a threshold likelihood below which the model just doesn't suit the data. 
If the classifier calculates the likelihood of the utterance for all the speakers is below that threshold, it would determine
that it is a new speaker.

3.2
Did not have time to vary parameters and do experiments.
With all the default parameters, the models achieved classifying ~46% of phonemes correctly.

3.3 Word error rates
substitution error = 16.54% 
insertion error = 4.23%
deletion error = 5%
Levenshtein distance = 25.77%

Substitution error is three times as common as other types of errors.
